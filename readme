My process of coming up with this solution:
	1. I created index.php with the eatery textbox. When submitted it will go to results.php
	2. In results.php I check to see if the post data for the eatery textbox is set, then call the search function. If
	   the post data isn't set, the user is redirected back to index.php to add their search criteria and try again.
	3. I created a database connection function (db_connect) that connects to my localhost (I'm running xammp on
	   my computer at home), which is called in the search function.
	4. Once connected to the database, I create the query that will be used to search for the results. I use place 
	   holders for the post eatery data, since it's NEVER a good idea to trust user input.
	6. If no results are found in the search, I display a "No results were found." message.
	7. If results are found, I display the necessary information for that establishment.
